# Task-4
🚀 Task 4 Completed – ApexPlanet Web Development Internship

I'm excited to share that I’ve successfully completed Task 4 of my internship at ApexPlanet, where I worked on a full-fledged multi-project portfolio implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🔹 Key Highlights:

💻 Personal Portfolio Website: Designed and developed a professional, fully responsive multi-page website with "About", "Projects", and "Contact" sections to showcase my skills and past work.

📝 To-Do List App with localStorage: Built a functional note-taking/to-do app that supports task creation, deletion, and data persistence using localStorage.

🛒 Product Page with Filters & Sorting: Implemented a dynamic product filter and sorting interface where users can filter by category/price and sort items by rating or relevance — ideal for e-commerce interfaces.

✅ Technologies Used:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), Flexbox, Grid, DOM Manipulation, and Local Storage API

🧠 These projects helped me strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation, responsive design, and state management using localStorage, and gave me real-world insight into frontend architecture.
